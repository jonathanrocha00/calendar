# Calendar UI sample
Implemented by Jonathan Rocha

### How to run project
Open the file `index.html` in any browser. Preferably, Chrome.

### How to add new events
Use the interface to add new events or open the file `scripts.js` and modify the block of code commented as "Standart input".

### About tests
Some prototype tests were created in the file `tests prototype.txt`.

### About the UI design
The UI was designed following the guide image as strictly as possible, but some modification were made to add clarity.

The events' colors are generated randomly by the function `getRandomColor()` inside `scripts.js`.

I personally judge the interface to be quite antiquated, but making it look better didn't seem to be the point of the activity, so I focused on the algorithm. It broke my heart to do so, by the way.
